## have to export in batches, because I can't figure out how to sort by multiple keywords all at once
## will export as '111111, bodypart_orientation'

## change file names to '111111_bodypart_orientation'

## https://sils.fnwi.uva.nl/bcb/objectj/2-Tutorial.html
## open object J 
## start/save new project into folder with image (e.g. in head lateral folder); needs to be in same folder as pics
## define objects as scale types
## define columns as 1) id 2-n) counts of each scale type
## link all images in the folder by drag and drop into imagej
## click through scales
## click ObjectJ results
## export

## can copy same empty "project" into another folder, so don't have to re-name variables, etc.
## copy projects into field_data folders
